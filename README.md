# Apexcify Technologies - Python Programming Tasks

Welcome to the **Apexcify Technologies All Projects** repository! This is a curated collection of innovative software projects developed by Apexcify Technologies. Each project demonstrates practical applications of programming concepts, from AI chatbots to automation tools and financial trackers.

## 📋 Python Programming Task List

- **TASK 1**: Email Automation System - Goal: Create a simple system where from one email we can send a same paragraph to multiple emails at the same time. Simplified Scope: Use a small list of 20 predefined emails (no need to use a file or API). No limit for receiving email we can send 100 plus peoples at the same time.
- **TASK 2**: Stock Portfolio Tracker - Goal: Build a simple stock tracker that calculates total investment based on manually defined stock prices. Simplified Scope: User inputs stock names and quantity. Use a hardcoded dictionary to define stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}). Display total investment value and optionally save the result in a .txt or .csv file. Key Concepts Used: dictionary, input/output, basic arithmetic, file handling(optional).
- **TASK 4**: Basic Chatbot - Goal: Build a simple rule-based chatbot. Scope: Input from user like "hello", "how are you", "bye". Predefined replies like "Hi!", "I'm fine, thanks!", "Goodbye!". Key Concepts Used: if-elif, functions, loops, input/output.
